\section{General Considerations}
The setup of the package is the following: $\gp$ is a $\no$-dimensional random
field on a domain $\nd$-dimensional
domain $D$.

Our philosophy is to always specify spatial location and response indices
together. That is, one should always specify \textbf{where} and \textbf{what}.

Spatial locations are denoted by $s$ and response indices by $\ell$. We will
use boldface (or, in the code, alternatively uppercase or plurals) to denote
vectors of such objects.

\medskip
A generalized sampling location is thus entirely defined by specifying two vectors
\begin{align*}
    \bm{s} &= \left(s_1, ..., s_n\right)\in D^n\\
    \bm{\ell} &= \left(\ell_1, ..., \ell_n\right) \in \lbrace 1, ..., \no
    \rbrace^n
\end{align*}
We will refer to $n$ as the \textit{dimension} of the generalized sampling
location and usually just talk of location, using the word \textit{spatial
location} when we want to specifically refer to points in $D$. Also, we will
use boldface $x$ as a shortcut to refer to the couple $\left(\bm{s},
\bm{\ell}\right)$ of spatial location vector and response index vector.
The shortcut notation $\gp[\bm{x}]$ thus refers to the
vector
\[
    \gp[\bm{x}]:=\left(\gp[s_1]^{\ell_1}, ..., \gp[s_n]^{\ell_n}\right) \in
    \mathbb{R}^n.
\]

\subsection{Covariance Model}
We assume a factor model which is the product of a stationary spatial component
with a response-index component
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Cov}\left(\gp[s]^i, \gp[t]^j\right) = k\left(s - t\right)
    \gamma\left(i, j\right).
\end{equation}

This makes implementation easier, since then, to compute the covariance matrix
of a generalized observations $\left(S, L\right)$, we first compute the
pairwise distance matrix
\[
    H = \textrm{cdist}\left(S,S, p=2\right) = \begin{pmatrix}
        ||s_1 - s_1|| & \dots & ||s_1 - s_n||\\
        \vdots &  & \vdots \\
        ||s_n - s_1|| & \dots & ||s_n - s_n||\\
    \end{pmatrix}
\]
which can then be feeded to a vectorized stationary covariance function to get
$K(H)$.

For the response index part, we compute $L_1, L_2=\textrm{meshgrid}\left(L,
L\right)$ which yields
\begin{align*}
    L_1 =  \begin{pmatrix}
        l_1 & \dots & l_1\\
        \vdots &  & \vdots \\
        l_n & \dots & l_n\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    &,~ 
    L_2 =  \begin{pmatrix}
        l_1 & \dots & l_n\\
        \vdots &  & \vdots \\
        l_1 & \dots & l_n\\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
and then feed it to a vectorized cross-covariance function $\gamma(L_1, L_2)$.
Finally, we get the covariance matrix by elementwise multiplication
\[
    K = K\left(H\right) \odot \gamma\left(L_1, L_2\right)
\]

\subsection{Cross-Covariance Models}
We here review different usual models for the cross-covariance part $\gamma(.,
.)$ of the covariance function. Recall that this is the part that specifies how
different components of the response vector at one fixed location interact.

\medskip
The simplest model we will consider is \textbf{uniform mixing}. In this model,
all components interact with the same coupling $\gamma_0$:
\begin{equation}
    \gamma(l, m) = \begin{cases} \sigma_l^2,~ l=m\\ 
        \gamma_0\sigma_l\sigma_m,~l\neq m
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
and $\sigma_1^2, ..., \sigma_{\no}^2$ are the variances of the individual
components.

\subsection{Implementation Details}
ATTENTION: torch.meshgrid behaves differently than numpy's one.
First of all, it takes single dimensional vectors.
\[
    L=(1,2,3,4),~ \textrm{torch.meshgrid}(L,L)=
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & \dots & 1\\
        \vdots &  & \vdots \\
        n & \dots & n\\
    \end{pmatrix}
    ,~ 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & \dots & n\\
        \vdots &  & \vdots \\
        1 & \dots & n\\
    \end{pmatrix}
\]

\section{Example Run}
We consider a $2$-dimensional GRF on a a $2$-dimensional $100\times 100$ regular grid on
$[0,1]^2$. The GRF has a factor covariance model, where the spatial part is a
Mat\'{e}rn $3/2$ with unit variance and lengthscale $\lambda_0 = 0.1$. The
cross-covariance is a uniform mixing with parameters
\[
    \sigma_1^2 = 0.25,~\sigma_2^2 = 0.6, \gamma_0 = 0.3
\]
and the mean function is a constant one with $\mu_0=(1, -2)$.
\medskip

The plot below shows one realization of the field on the full grid.

We can also increase the cross-correlation factor $\gamma_0$ to $0.9$ to see
its effect.

\section{Hardware/Software Specifications}
The AUV feature a Nvidia TX1 with ubuntu 16.04. Current programs use Python
2.7, but 3.7 can be used.
In order to run 3.7, we have to run
another backseat-driver (responsible for sending waypoints to the low-leve
controllers).

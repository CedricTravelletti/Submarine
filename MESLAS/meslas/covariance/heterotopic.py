""" Code for multidimensional sampling.
We will be considering multivariate random fields Z=(Z^1, ..., Z^p).
The term *response index* denotes the index of the component of the field we
ate considering.

We will sometime use the word measurement point to denote a
(location, response index) pair.

We will be using the notation conventions from the papers.

    x's will denote a location
    j's will denote reponse a index

Uppercase for concatenated quantities, i.e. a big X is a vector of x's.

First dimension of tensors represent the different samples/locations (batch
dimension).
Other dimensions are for the "dimensions" of the repsonse (or input domain).

THIS IS FOR HETEROTOPIC SAMPLING (most general form).

# TODO: Inmplement convenience methods for full sampling (all indices).

Conventions
-----------
Spatial locations will be denoted by s, capital letters for bunches.
Response indices denoted by l.
Couple of (locations, response indices) denoted by x.

    Parameters
    ----------

        matrix H and a purely response index component. L1 and L2 are the
